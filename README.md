# Overview

This crate mainly deals with issuing and maintaining stability of indices.
It provides 4 structs and each helps in different area.
This library was created for my game development endeavor.
Not going great on that front as I kept restarting the project.
However, I saw these utility structures coming back multiple times so I'm making a crate for them.

# installation

```sh
cargo add stable-id stable-id-traits derive-stable-id
```
